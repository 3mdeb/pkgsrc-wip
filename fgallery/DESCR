Fgallery is a minimalist javascript photo gallery.

It is a static photo gallery generator with no frills that has a
stylish, minimalist look: it shows your photos, and nothing else.

You can see an example gallery at the following address:

resulting gallery can be uploaded anywhere without additional
requirements and works with any modern browser.
