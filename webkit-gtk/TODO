- Review JIT support for NetBSD:
   * patches/patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_runtime_MachineContext.h
   * patches/patch-Source_WTF_wtf_Platform.h
  Only amd64 was actually tested and arm, arm64 and mips really need a
  double-check.
- Enable webkit-jit option
- Could the NetBSD logic in
  patches/patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_runtime_MachineContext.h be rewritten
  using ucontext(2) _UC_MACHINE_* macros instead?
