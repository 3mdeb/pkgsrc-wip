webkit-gtk: Update www/webkit-gtk to 2.22.2

pkgsrc changes:
 - Bump GCC_REQD to 6.0 (now gcc 6.0.0 or newer is needed)
 - Add NetBSD support for JavaScript JIT on x86_64, i386, arm,
   aarch64 and mips
 - Improve handling of `webkit-jit' by introducing a
   WEBKIT_JIT_MACHINE_PLATFORMS list that contain all MACHINE_PLATFORMs
   triplets that have `webkit-jit' option as suggested one.
 - Always use OS(...) and BOS(...) macros instead of __Os__ macros for
   consistency with webkit code.
 - Add definition for BOS(SOLARIS) and OS(SOLARIS) and use them consistently
   instead of using `__sun' macro.
 - Limit patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_jit_ExecutableAllocator.cpp to
   OpenBSD. It is no longer present on FreeBSD ports and it is not
   problematic on NetBSD.
 - Remove no longer needed patch-Source_WTF_wtf_ThreadSpecific.h:
   NetBSD 5.x was already part of NOT_FOR_PLATFORM.
 - Sync patch-CMakeLists.txt with FreeBSD ports.
   Please note that this also remove WTF_CPU_SPARC64 definition that was
   unused.
 - Use globbing for REPLACE_{PERL,PYTHON} where possible

=================
  - Several fixes for video playback with media source extensions (MSE).
    This allows using WebM support for YouTube, which no longer works through

    webkit_settings_set_enable_mediasource() has to be used to enable the
    feature.
  - Fix the build when only Wayland support is enabled and X11 headers are
    not available.

=================
  - Fix printing in landscape.
