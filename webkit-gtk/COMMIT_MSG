Changes:
WebKitGTK+ 2.22.2
=================
  - Several fixes for video playback with media source extensions (MSE).
    This allows using WebM support for YouTube, which no longer works through
    regular video source. Note that MSE is still disabled by default and
    webkit_settings_set_enable_mediasource() has to be used to enable the
    feature.
  - Fix the build when only Wayland support is enabled and X11 headers are
    not available.

WebKitGTK+ 2.22.1
=================
  - Fix printing in landscape.
  - Fix the build in several platforms: s390x, ppc64le, armv7hl.
  - Fix the build with a11y disabled.
  - Fix the build with video disabled.
  - Fix several crashes and rendering issues.

WebKitGTK+ 2.22.0
==================
  - Add warn_unused_result attribute to some JavaScriptCore GLib APIs.
  - Make pinch to zoom scale the page without changing the layout.
  - Fix the build in mips64.
