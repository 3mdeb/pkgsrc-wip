chmlib is a small library designed for accessing MS ITSS files.  The ITSS file
format is used for Microsoft Html Help files (.chm), which have been the
predominant medium for software documentation from Microsoft during the past
several years, having superceded the previously used .hlp file format.

Note that this is NOT the same as the OLE structured storage file format used
by MS Excel, Word, and so on.  Instead, it is a different file format which
fulfills a similar purpose.  Both file formats may be accessed via instances
of the IStorage COM interface, which is essentially an "acts like a
filesystem" interface.
