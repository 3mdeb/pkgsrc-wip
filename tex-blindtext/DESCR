The blindtext package provides commands to create dummy ("blind") text
for testing new classes, packages, etc.  The commands generate text,
paragraphs, nested lists, mathematics, and entire documents containing
sections, lists, mathematics, and table of contents.  Supported languages
include, english, (n)german, french, catalan, and latin; the latin option
provides a short "lorem ipsum" (for a longer lorem ipsum text, see the
lipsum package).
