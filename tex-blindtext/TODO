Distfile verification:

  * I've verified that the md5 hash and size of the distfile downloaded
    from ctan, blindtext.tar.xz, match the values given in the current
    version of the texlive database entry for blindtext in
      http://mirrors.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.xz
    and the hashes in distinfo were calculated using that file.

Category choices:

  Since it's pitched at testing new classes and packages, devel is a
  potential primary category.  It could also be a good way for users
  to try out existing classes and packages, so print is also a
  potential primary category.  I chose devel, but not with much
  conviction.

License choice:

  * The README file, in the doc pkg and on the home page, says:
      "License type:         LaTeX Project Public License"

  * The texlive database entry says:
      catalogue-license lppl

    The closest analogs in license.mk and pkgsrc/licenses are:
      lppl-1.0 lppl-1.2 lppl-1.3c

  * The .sty file says:
      "License type:         Free"

    There doesn't seem to be any analog in license.mk or pkgsrc/licenses,
    but the word "copyright" (case-insensitive search) does not appear in
    any of the files in the package, the doc package, or the source
    package.  So, maybe the closest analogous license is:
      public-domain

  * I decided to go with lppl-1.3c, since it was the version in effect at
    the time that the latest version of blindtext was contributed to
    ctan, and "Latex Project Public License" is prominently displayed on
    the home page.  In the source .dtx file there are a few changes with
    dates that predate lppl-1.3c, but there is no evidence of a date for
    an original version.  The earliest date mentioned is in the line:
      \changes{V1.3}{2003-05-18}{Cascaded lists}.

    However, some other texlive packages specify a version explicitly,
    and this one does not, so maybe the default should be lppl-1.0?

Checklist for import to pkgsrc:

  * Reevaluate my choice of parent directory.  If changed from devel to
    print, reverse the order of the items in CATEGORIES in Makefile.

  * Reevaluate my choice of license.

  * Mirror the distfile: once the distfile has been copied to pkgsrc
    mirrors, the line
      TEXLIVE_USE_CTAN=	yes
    should be removed from the Makefile.

  * Import.

  * Activate: in devel/Makefile, add
      SUBDIR+=	tex-blindtext

  * Update meta-pkgs/texlive-collection/latexextra/Makefile, changing
      # depend blindtext
    to
      DEPENDS+=	tex-blindtext-[0-9]*:../../<category>/tex-blindtext
    where <category> is the chosen parent directory.
