TODO: include 8.0.0beta1...8.2.24 changes

-- ircd-hybrid-7.3.1 Release Notes
o) Fixed ERR_ACCEPTEXIST numeric string. Now gives proper
   nick!user@host mask output
o) Update RPL_ISUPPORT. CHANMODES now reflects new +OS channelmodes
o) Fixed random core triggered by exiting servers
o) Fixed invalid user and invisible count in /lusers which sometimes can
   occur if a server sends redundant usermodes within a NICK message


-- ircd-hybrid-7.3.0 Release Notes
o) Added Bulgarian language file provided by Borislav Borisov
o) Server hostmasking has been removed due to TS6 requirements
o) Fixed broken IPv6 detection
o) Minor code optimizations. Reduced memory consumption
o) User IDs are now shown in client connection notices
o) Increased maximum temporary kline time to 360 days
o) Added back STATS/TRACE/MOTD/ADMIN request notices. Removed
   spy_*_notice modules accordingly.
o) Channelmode +O; channel can be joined by ircops only.
o) Channelmode +S; only clients with a secure connection (ssl/tls)
   can join this channel.


-- ircd-hybrid-7.3-rc1 Release Notes
o) Major 64-bit cleanups and portability fixes.
o) Fixed bug where unregistered clients were not able to complete registration
   process with /quote PONG <ping_cookie> in case the client was assigned a
   zero value ping-cookie. This may only happen with general::ping_cookie
   being enabled.
o) "STATS z" now shows the actual amount of memory consumption being
   used by channel bans/excepts/invites.
o) Fixed archaic bug where bursting servers with missconfigured NICKLEN were
   able to desync the network's nickname database.
o) The PCRE library has been removed from the ircd sources. ./configure will
   now automatically detect an already installed version of the PCRE library.
o) Various resolver improvements and fixes
o) Implemented GUNGLINE (global ungline)
o) Completely rewrote build system. We're now using automake and libtool
o) Added support for SHA-256/512 encrypted passwords to mkpasswd. Whether
   passwords hashed using these algorithms will work depends on the system's
   crypt() implementation. For example, SHA-256/512 is available in glibc since
   version 2.7.
o) Added ssl_server_protocol configuration option to servinfo{}.
   Valid flags are 'sslv3' and 'tlsv1'
o) Added new 'server' option to listener::flags. Listener with that flag
   set may only accept server connections.
o) Fixed occasional core when placing RESVs on channel names
o) Fixed topic desynchronization which sometimes may
   happen during netbursts
o) WATCH support implemented. Known from other irc-daemons, such
   as Dreamforge and Bahamut. The general::max_watch configuration directive
   has been added in order to allow run-time configuration of how many
   watch entries a single client may have on its watchlist.
o) Fixed bug which would cause invalid invisible counts on oper-up in case
   operator::umodes and/or general::oper_umodes contains 'invisible'
o) Removed broken LazyLinks
o) Removed --disable-gline-voting configure option
o) Minor code optimizations and cleanups
o) ACCEPT now supports nick!user@host masks
o) Unregistered clients are no longer allowed to request the server's motd
o) general::dot_in_ip6_addr configuration option is obsolete and no longer exists
o) Dropped support for old style 'operflag = yes|no;' format
