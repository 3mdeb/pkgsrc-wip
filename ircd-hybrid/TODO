- Should a default configuration be provided?
  After the installation if it is tried to run it, it will fails
  due to missing etc/ircd-hybrid/ircd.conf (chat/ircd-hybrid used
  ${WRKSRC}/etc/example.conf as ircd.conf)
- Double-check if *.conf files (and maybe other files) in INSTALL still need to
  be created
