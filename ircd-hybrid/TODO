- Should a default configuration be provided?
  After the installation if it is tried to run it, it will fails due to missing
  etc/ircd-hybrid/ircd.conf.
- Double-check if *.conf files (and maybe other files) in INSTALL still need to
  be created
- Investigate if share/ircd-hybrid/messages still need to be appended to
  INSTALLATION_DIRS and if not remove it and update PLIST accordingly
- Investigate if the `@pkgdir share/examples/ircd-hybrid' is still needed in
  PLIST
- Investigate if etc/reference.conf is actually used by ircd
- files installed in share/doc/ircd-hybrid/doc/ can be probably installed
  directly in share/doc/ircd-hybrid
