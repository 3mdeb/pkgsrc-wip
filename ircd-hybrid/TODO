- Should a default configuration be provided?
  After the installation if it is tried to run it, it will fails due to missing
  etc/ircd-hybrid/ircd.conf.
- Double-check if *.conf files (and maybe other files) in INSTALL still need to
  be created
- files installed in share/doc/ircd-hybrid/doc/ can be probably installed
  directly in share/doc/ircd-hybrid
