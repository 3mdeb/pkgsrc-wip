The upstream code has problems. They use a specific toolchain to mitigate
that.

I couldn't get it to start without segfaulting on NetBSD amd64 with clang
and gcc5, same on Armbian with gcc 4.9.

According to upstream it depends on gcc 4.8, which works on amd64.

(This has always been the case, and isn't just specific to this newer
version.)
