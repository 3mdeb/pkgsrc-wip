$NetBSD$

- This package should probably eventually replace wip/proxychains/
  which uses a codebase that is apparently no longer maintained.
- It does not use a standard GNU configure script, and with the
  combination of NetBSD-7/pkgsrc-2016Q2, the build is broken if not
  explicitely doing it in do-build:; it appears that although the
  configure script does place its variables in its config.mak, and
  its Makefile does include that file, the -D flags do not propagate
  properly, causing a build failure in relation to inaddr OS-specifics.
  It is unclear to me exactly why.  As a result of all this, the
  package may not be as portable as it should be.
- Lacks a manual page.
