* Double-check the `+=' usage in CFLAGS+= and X11_LDFLAGS+= in WINE32_ENV
  definition
* --x-libraries is passed via WINE32_ARGS, why X11_LDFLAGS is also passed via
  WINE32_ENV, could it be handled via configure arguments as well?
* There are:
   warning: "_FORTIFY_SOURCE" redefined
  when building.  Investigate if fortify is supported upstream or if an
  exception should be added.
* We need to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/pkg/emul/netbsd32/lib owing
  to X11 32-bit libs from compat80-x11 not linking against libxcb.so
  in ${PREFIX}/emul/netbsd32/lib.
* Gracefully handle MAKE_JOBS when it is not defined
