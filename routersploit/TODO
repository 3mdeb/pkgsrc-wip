By using e.g. scanners/autopwn and setting a target, several threads
are started but they quickly terminate, e.g.:

 [...]
 [*] Running module...
 
 [*] Starting vulnerablity check...
 [*] thread-0 thread is starting...
 [*] thread-1 thread is starting...
 [...]
 [*] thread-0 thread is terminated.
 [*] thread-1 thread is terminated.

 [*] Starting default credentials check...
 [*] thread-0 thread is starting...
 [*] thread-1 thread is starting...
 [...]
 [*] thread-0 thread is terminated.
 [*] thread-1 thread is terminated.

There is probably something bad going on, investigate further.
At least routersploit-2.2.1nb20180305 (routersploit-git) seemed to
properly work.

At least ktruss-ing it reveals that a open("routersploit/...")
fails due ENOENT, probably routersploit modules are not gracefully
picked up?
