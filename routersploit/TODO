By using e.g. scanners/autopwn and setting a target, several threads
are started but they quickly terminate, e.g.:

 [...]
 [*] Running module...
 
 [*] Starting vulnerablity check...
 [*] thread-0 thread is starting...
 [*] thread-1 thread is starting...
 [...]
 [*] thread-0 thread is terminated.
 [*] thread-1 thread is terminated.
 [...]
 
 [*] Elapsed time: 0.0001952648162841797 seconds
 
 [*] Starting default credentials check...
 [*] thread-0 thread is starting...
 [*] thread-1 thread is starting...
 [...]
 [*] thread-0 thread is terminated.
 [*] thread-1 thread is terminated.
 [...]
 
 [*] Elapsed time: 0.00017380714416503906 seconds
 [...]

At least ktruss-ing it reveals that several open("routersploit/...")
fails due ENOENT.  If the $PWD is ${PYSITELIB} and then directly
invoking routersploit in the python interpreter via:

 >>> from routersploit.interpreter import RoutersploitInterpreter
 >>> rsf = RoutersploitInterpreter()
 >>> rsf.start()

routersploit works as usual!
