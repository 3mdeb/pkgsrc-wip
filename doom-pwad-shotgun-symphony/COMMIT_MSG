Import games/doom-pwad-shotgun-symphony

An oldschool mapset for E1 of Ultimate Doom, in the combined E1/E2 style
of Fava Beans, but much more violent. Mapset is optimized for pistol start,
though there are occasional goodies for continuous players. Every map exits
directly into the next, creating a single, giant facility.
