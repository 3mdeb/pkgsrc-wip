If your webserver does not run as "${WWW_USER}", you should
chown ${GRAPHITE_LOG_DIR}/webapp and ${GRAPHITE_DIR} (but
not the subdirectories) to be owned by the user your webserver
runs as.

If you will be using a different database (besides sqlite3),
you will need to install the appropriate python package
to support it.
