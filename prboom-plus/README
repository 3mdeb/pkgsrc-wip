If you see crashes only with certain maps and only on big endian machines
like PowerPC or SPARC, try this patched version.

This package fixes the following bug in prboom+ 2.5.1.4:
Loading maps using ZDoom extended nodes crashes on big endian machines
(because 32-bit values are imported with wrong byte order).

This bug was reported and is already fixed upstream.
This package will stay in wip until the next release of prboom+.
