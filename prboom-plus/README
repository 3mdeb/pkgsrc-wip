If you see crashes only with certain maps and only on big endian machines
like PowerPC or SPARC, try this patched version.

This package fixes the following bug in prboom+ 2.5.1.4:
Loading maps using extended nodes crashes on big endian machines
(because 32-bit values are imported with wrong byte order).

Bug was reported and is already fixed upstream

This package will stay in wip until the next release of PrBoom+.
