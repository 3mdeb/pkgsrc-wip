nmh: Update mail/nmh to 1.7

pkgsrc changes:

TODO: double-check if all of that are relevant for mail/nmh and eventually sort
TODO: them as needed

 - Add support for the `test' phase

   Add support for nmh tests. Modify patches/patch-ca accordingly in order to
   adjust TEST_ENVIRONMENT to use the configuration files in $egdir instead of the
   ones in $nmhetcdir.
   Actually all tests are passed except an mhparam test that sposts the
   $egdir/$nmetcdir kludge.

 - Update MASTER_SITES (use https:// and avoid redirects)

 - Delete (a bit outdated) comment about locking mechanisms

   Since 02 Feb 2014 (post-1.6) the default locking mechanisms are
   (directly from m4/locking.m4):

    - aix*|cygwin*|linux*: fcntl
    - freebsd*|*netbsd*|openbsd*|darwin*: flock
    - everything else: dot

   The original comment was probably about just NetBSD and maybe Solaris
   (it's dated 1999). Solaris still uses the `dot' mechanisms by default
   but we no longer have any local patches about locking.

 - Delete (no more needed) `-O1' hack to CFLAGS

   mh_strcasecmp() was completely replaced by strcasecmp() on 24 Mar 2013, and
   hence present in 1.6. Forcing `-O1' for gcc is no longer needed.

 - Do not include bsd.prefs.mk two times (NFC)
