PDF are not correctly rendered... and a lot of:

 error: Rendering failed (page ...)

errors are printed...

Putting a breakpoint on pdf_page_render_to_buffer() function that
is invoked as part of render_job() (defined in zathura)
ZATHURA_ERROR_UNKNOWN is always returned because `image' argument
is always NULL (hence `image == NULL' is true).
