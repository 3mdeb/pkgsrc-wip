Everything seems working but there are probably new regression due to 1.10 API
migration that needs to be further investigated in order to update
print/zathura-pdf-mupdf:

- Gtk-WARNING **: Allocating size to zathura [address] without calling
  gtk_widget_get_preferred_width/height().  How does the code know the size to
  allocate? [seems to happen when `Tab' is pressed, i.e. in the `Index mode']
- warning: dropping unclosed device [probably related to the `search' command
  (i.e. via `/') that no longer works]
