zathura-pdf-mupdf: Backport patches from upstream and adapt to MuPDF 1.2.0 API

- Backport all the relevant patches from upstream (NFCI, most of them were
  already backported but diverged a bit from upstream).
- Delete patches/patch-links.c, I can no longer reproduce the NULL pointer
  dereference with mupdf-1.2.0.
- Backport MuPDF 1.2.0 API update

With these zathura-pdf-mupdf works with mupdf-1.2.0.

Bump PKGREVISION.
