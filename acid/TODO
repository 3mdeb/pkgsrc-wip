This is ACID which is basically a PHP-based analysis engine to search and 
process a database of security events generated by various IDSes, firewalls, 
and network monitoring tools.  It's mainly used for snort when logging to mySQL
databases.

This requires a few packages which are not in the main pkgsrc tree but are in
pkgsrc/wip.  Specifically adodb and jpgraph will be pulled in when you install
this package.

Tested on NetBSD 1.6 i386.

Ta,

Adrian.
