- Needs double-check to see if all compononents are properly installed and setup
  like in swi-prolog-packages-7.6.4.
- bin/swi-prolog is no longer available/installed, is this intended or is it a
  regression? (this is probably intended, also the documentation always refers
  to swipl)
  Was it just a link to bin/swipl or did it also loaded some modules?
- Built-in help (e.g. via help/1 or apropos/1) does not work with swipl...
  It seems that library/help.pl is installed based on INSTALL_DOCUMENTATION in
  src/CMakeLists.txt, but it is should be part of swi-prolog-lite library (that
  have -DINSTALL_DOCUMENTATION=OFF).  We should probably install it
  unconditionally as part of swi-prolog-lite.
