- Needs double-check to see if all compononents are properly installed and setup
  like in swi-prolog-packages-7.6.4.
- bin/swi-prolog is now installed as bin/swipl
  This is because in src/CMakeLists.txt:

  | function(config_data_files)
  |   set(PL swipl)

  Previously a PL variable was passed... It is probably better to document that
  change in the commit message (swi-prolog -> swipl) and just follow upstream 
  nomenclature.
- Built-in help (e.g. via help/1 or apropos/1) does not work with swipl...
  It seems that library/help.pl is installed based on INSTALL_DOCUMENTATION in
  src/CMakeLists.txt, but it is should be part of swi-prolog-lite library (that
  have -DINSTALL_DOCUMENTATION=OFF).  We should probably install it
  unconditionally as part of swi-prolog-lite.
  Please also see swi-prolog-lite/TODO.
