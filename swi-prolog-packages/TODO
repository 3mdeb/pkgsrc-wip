- Double check dependencies and bl3 include (probably we can't get rid of them
  but mark the one used in swi-prolog-lite only as build depends...)
- bin/swi-prolog is now installed as bin/swipl
  This is because in src/CMakeLists.txt:

  | function(config_data_files)
  |   set(PL swipl)

  Previously a PL variable was passed... It is probably better to document that
  change in the commit message (swi-prolog -> swipl) and just follow upstream 
  nomenclature.
- Update DESCR to reflect current reality (several packages are in
  swi-prolog-lite now)
