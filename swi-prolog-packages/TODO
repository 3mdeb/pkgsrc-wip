- `install' phase needs to be tested and adjusted.

  According quick `build-env' tests probably do-install: needs to be adjusted in
  order to manually invoke something like that:

   DESTDIR=${DESTDIR} cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_COMPONENT=<component> -P cmake_install.cmake

  for each components that we would like to install (at the moment despite
  passing them via CMAKE_ARGS also components provided by swi-prolog-lite
  are installed).
