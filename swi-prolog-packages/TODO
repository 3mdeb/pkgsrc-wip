- Needs double-check to see if all compononents are properly installed and setup
  like in swi-prolog-packages-7.6.4.
- bin/swi-prolog is no longer available/installed, is this intended or is it a
  regression?
  Was it just a link to bin/swipl or did it also loaded some modules?
- Built-in help (e.g. via help/1 or apropos/1) does not work with swipl (not
  sure if this is a regression or possibly related to missing bin/swi-prolog)
