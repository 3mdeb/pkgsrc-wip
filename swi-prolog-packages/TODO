- Needs double-check to see if all compononents are properly installed and setup
  like in swi-prolog-packages-7.6.4.
- bin/swi-prolog is now installed as bin/swipl
  This is because in src/CMakeLists.txt:

  | function(config_data_files)
  |   set(PL swipl)

  Previously a PL variable was passed... It is probably better to document that
  change in the commit message (swi-prolog -> swipl) and just follow upstream 
  nomenclature.
