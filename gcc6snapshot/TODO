0) Work on gcc should happen upstream as far as possible. But it is 
hopeless without NetBSD developers working on it upstream. I have sent
some patches for NetBSD to gcc upstream a few month ago but there is
no progress yet.  

PR 64271, the minimal patch set to bootstrap, extracted from pkgsrc.
Jonathan Wakely is working on the libstdc++ patches involved.
Without acceptance of patches for PR 64271, no other patches
will be accepted upstream. 

PR 39570, this bug causes all gfortran run tests to fail. I have developed
the necessary patches and sent them upstream. For gcc50snapshot it means
replacing a short patch by a bunch of complex patches, but they are gcc
conforming and can be reused for other patches as well.

PR 48244, for iso_c_binding support in gfortran. The patches are
there but it is delayed by PR 64271.


1) On NetBSD a working cabsl function must be present in libm to build gfortran.
This has been added to NetBSD7 on 2014/10/13. Before this date it was defined
in complex.h but missing from libm.
 
2) This package and the lang/gcc4x need a cleanup or a complete new start. I
think that SUBST_VARS could handle the platform dependencies in a much cleaner
way.


Have fun,
