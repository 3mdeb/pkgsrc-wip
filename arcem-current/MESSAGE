When you run arcem, you need to be in a directory containing the
arcem files and the ROM file. The distribution is supplied with the
Linux ROM and Hard Drive files from Dave Gilbert's site. The hard drive
file needs to be writable by you. For example:

  $ mkdir ~/Archimedes
  $ cp ${PREFIX}/share/arcem/* ~/Archimedes
  $ cp ~/Archimedes/dot.arcemrc ~/.arcemrc
  $ cd ~/Archimedes
  $ chmod +w HardImage1
  $ arcem
