This release does not contain new "ABI features".
The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is 100% compatible
with releases 1.3.4, 1.3.4-1, and 1.3.4-2.


Changes in FLTK 1.3.5
=====================

New features and enhancements (highlights):

  - Add support for macOS 10.13 "High Sierra" and 10.14 "Mojave".
  - Add FL/platform.H for compatibility with FLTK 1.4 and higher.
  - Improve OpenGL(3+) support.
  - Improve Cairo support and (CMake) Cairo detection.
  - Improve desktop scaling support for HiDPI screens.
    Note: FLTK application scaling is available in FLTK 1.4.0.


Bug fixes and other improvements:

  - Update CHANGES for release, remove one wrong entry
  - Fix Xcode FLTK project for use under macOS 10.14
  - Fix for STR 3473 (and its duplicate STR 3507) to restore configure-based
    builds on recent Linux/Unix distributions where the freetype-config
    command has been replaced by pkg-config.
  - Fix Fl_Tree::insert() with pos out ouf range (issue #18).
  - Fix Fl_GIF_Image Color Table handling (STR 3491).
  - Make sure not to access Fl_Menu_ widgets if the widget gets
    deleted while the menu (pulldown) is open (STR 3503).
  - Fix CMake build (fluid) on case sensitive macOS file systems.
  - Windows/OpenGL: improve pixel format detection (STR 3119).
  - Add support for macOS 10.14 "Mojave": all drawing to windows is done
    through "layer-backed views" when the app is linked to SDK 10.14.
  - MacOS platform: fix regression in macOS 10.13 where an unbundled app
    had its system menu bar unresponsive.
  - MacOS 10.10 platform: Fl_Window::fullscreen() and fullscreen_off()
    no longer call Fl_Window::hide() + Fl_Window::show().
    The new procedure essentially resizes the window, as done on
    the X11+EWMH and Windows platforms. This improves in particular
    the possibility to turn an Fl_Gl_Window fullscreen on and off.
  - MacOS platform: Support \r\n as end of line used by recent
    MS Office apps in clipboard.
  - Fix Fl_Text_Editor overstrike mode (STR 3463).
  - More consistent and optimized "gleam" scheme box drawing.
  - Fix a MinGW build error with new MinGW versions as of Feb 2018
    (undefined S_OK and __FD_ISSET), see STR 3454.
  - Windows/CMake: Add missing definition of WIN32 for Windows builds.
    This seems to be necessary for VS2017 and other compilers that
    don't #define WIN32, but FLTK relies on this preprocessor macro.
    Autoconf/configure and bundled IDE files #define WIN32 as well.
  - Fix illegal memory access after free when closing fluid (valgrind
    reports "Invalid read of size 4"), see also STR 3427.
  - Fix crash when closing fluid with Fl_Table (STR 3427).
  - Fix ignored buffer pre-allocation (requestedSize) in Fl_Text_Buffer.
    See fltk.general "Fl_Text_Buffer constructor bug" on Dec 5, 2016.
  - Fix Fl_Browser background and text color parsing (STR 3376).
  - Fix Windows CreateDC/DeleteDC mismatch (STR 3373).
  - Update bundled configure scripts config.guess and config.sub.
  - Fix configure --enable-cairo --enable-cairoext,
    see this report in fltk.general
  - Fix macOS timer implementation (STR 3387).
  - Fix drop-to-FLTK-widget under MSWindows when the desktop is
    rescaled (STR 3390).
  - Add support for macOS 10.13 "High Sierra". Subwindows don't
    move correctly under 10.13 without this fix.
