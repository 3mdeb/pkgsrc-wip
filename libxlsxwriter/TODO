stage-install fails on macOS:

  => Checking for missing run-time search paths in libxlsxwriter-0.8.4
  ERROR: lib/libxlsxwriter.dylib: missing library: /usr/lib/libxlsxwriter.dylib

Seems to be caused by this bit in src/Makefile:

  SOFLAGS = -dynamiclib $(FPIC) -install_name /usr/lib/$(LIBXLSXWRITER_SO)
