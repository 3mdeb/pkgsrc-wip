Part 7: Import final release
============================
[X] Import version 1.48.4 to pkgsrc
    Parts 1 to 6 are now available in games/doomlegacy


Part 8: Support for extended nodes
==================================
[X] Add patch to support DeeP and ZDoom extended nodes
    This code is based on woof 1.2.0
    Fixes Bug #657
[X] Created upstream feature request #95
    => Deferred (not considered for 1.48 release)
[X] Add optional zlib dependency for build system
[X] Add support for compressed ZDoom extended nodes
    Use "zdbsp -z" to create test map with compressed ZDoom extended nodes
    => Works as expected


Part 9: Support for internal blockmap creation
==============================================
Make it possible to play maps with broken blockmaps (or no blockmaps at all).

[X] Add patch to support internal blockmap creation
    This code is based on Crispy Doom 5.8.0
[X] Add command line option "-blockmap" like in PrBoom+
[X] Document option "-blockmap" in man page
[X] Test as workaround for NOVA II
    Blockmap load error, Bug #658
    => Works as expected (needs Feature #95 too)
[X] Test as as workaround for NOVA III
    Blockmaps missing completely (needs Feature #95 too)
    => Works as expected
[X] Test as workaround for Lost Civilization
    It's unclear whether the blockmaps are broken or not imported correctly
    => Works as expected
[X] Created upstream feature request #96


Part 10: Some textures show pink/black/pink stripes
===================================================
Just a cosmetic problem.

[X] Created upstream bug report #663
    Reason was missing support for DeePsea tall patches (see Part 12)
    Fixed in SVN revision 1547
    => Works as expected

Part 10 finished.


Part 11: Resurrect SunOS codepath
=================================
[X] Explicitly define SOLARIS for all SunOS-based operating systems
    Required at least for SmartOS
[X] Do not use label_t
    Comment out declaration of unused function with return value of that type
[X] Use native inet_aton()
    Located in libresolv on SunOS
[X] Use fcntl() instead of ioctl() to enable non-blocking mode of socket
    Should be usable for all POSIX conformant operating systems
[X] Created upstream bug report #666
    Patches merged in SVN revision 1548
[X] Remove pkgsrc patches for SunOS support

Part 11 finished.


Part 12: Support for DeePsea tall patches in textures and sprites
=================================================================
WAD file for test:
http://jnechaevsky.users.sourceforge.net/files/512x512.wad

[X] Import general support from Crispy Doom
[X] Tested to work for sprites with software renderer
[X] Make it work for textures with hardware renderer
[X] Propose reduced patchset upstream
    => Support for DeePsea tall patches was added in SVN revision 1547
[X] Test upstream patches
    => Works now with software and hardware renderer
[X] Remove pkgsrc patches for DeePsea tall patches

The hardware renderer still has some problems (HOM with specific viewing
angles). This looks unrelated to the texture format.

Part 12 finished.


Part 13: Problem with masked textures if width not a power of 2
===============================================================
[X] Discussed while testing fix for bug #663 with Lost Civilization
    => Problem with a large tree in Map 1
    => A similar problem exist with the rotating saw blade in Map 4
    Fixed in SVN revision 1549
    => Works as expected

Part 13 finished.


Part 14: Import final release
=============================
[ ] Import version 1.48.6 to pkgsrc
