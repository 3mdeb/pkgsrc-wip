Swift 4.0 is currently on Beta release, please uninstall older Swift
packages before upgrading to this release on Windows. The main
changes since 3.0 are:

* Support for message carbons (XEP-0280)
* Improved spell checker support on Linux
* Enabled trellis mode as a default feature, allowing several
  tiled chats windows to be shown at once
* New chat theme including a new font
* Assorted smaller features and usability enhancements
* Fix Swift bug introduced in 4.0-beta1 that results in the UI
  sometimes getting stuck during login

Thanks to all our contributors of code, translations, testing, ideas
and other support.
