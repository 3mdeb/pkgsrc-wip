- Probably we should try to follow `Modular packages for Linux' section in
  CMAKE.md in order to make swi-prolog pkgsrc packaging similar to the ones
  in pre-cmake era (probably also need to be added `-P cmake_install.cmake' to
  CMAKE_ARGS in Makefile.common in order to be honored)
- Double-check that all removed patches are actually no longer
  needed (most of them were applied but maybe some build related ones
  needs to be adopted for cmake migration)
- -DINSTALL_DOCUMENTATION=OFF is needed otherwise the build fails with:
   don't know how to make ../man/pldoc. Stop
  This probably fails because we pass -DSWIPL_PACKAGES=OFF and
  -DINSTALL_DOCUMENTATION=ON actually needs some packages.
  We should probably explicitly disable all packages in
  swi-prolog-lite/Makefile (similarly to what we do in
  swi-prolog-packages/Makefile) except SWIPL_PACKAGES_BASIC and remove
  -DSWIPL_PACKAGES=OFF.  Unfortunately doing that seems to pick up
  several further dependencies (e.g. ossp-uuid) leading the build
  to fails.  Analyze if it is possible to avoid that.
- -DSWIPL_SHARED_LIB=ON probably should be enabled for swi-prolog-jpl
