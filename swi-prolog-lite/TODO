- Is patches/patch-packages_Dialect.defs.in really needed?  If yes, why?
  (Please document the patch!)
- Probably buildlink3.mk should not include ncurses bl3 (no .so are directly
  provided as part of swi-prolog-lite)
- Investigate if it is possible/better to use curses.buildlink3.mk (instead of
  ncurses bl3)
