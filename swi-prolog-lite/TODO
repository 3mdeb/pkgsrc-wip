- Probably we should try to follow `Modular packages for Linux' section in
  CMAKE.md in order to make swi-prolog pkgsrc packaging similar to the ones
  in pre-cmake era (probably also need to be added `-P cmake_install.cmake' to
  CMAKE_ARGS in Makefile.common in order to be honored)
- Double-check that all removed patches are actually no longer
  needed (most of them were applied but maybe some build related ones
  needs to be adopted for cmake migration)
- -DSWIPL_SHARED_LIB=ON probably should be enabled for swi-prolog-jpl
