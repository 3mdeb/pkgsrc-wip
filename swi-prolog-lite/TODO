- Probably we should try to follow `Modular packages for Linux' section in
  CMAKE.md in order to make swi-prolog pkgsrc packaging similar to the ones
  in pre-cmake era (probably also need to be added `-P cmake_install.cmake' to
  CMAKE_ARGS in Makefile.common in order to be honored)
- Double-check that all removed patches are actually no longer
  needed (most of them were applied but maybe some build related ones
  needs to be adopted for cmake migration)
- -DINSTALL_DOCUMENTATION=OFF is needed otherwise the build fails with:
   don't know how to make ../man/pldoc. Stop
  Investigate if there is a way to solve that and provide the documentation via
  swi-prolog-lite package.
