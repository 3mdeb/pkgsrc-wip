swi-prolog*: Update to 8.0.1

pkgsrc changes:
 - Rename swi-prolog to swipl to follow upstream nomenclature
 - Add all main packages (except X11) to swi-prolog-lite.
   After CMake migration in order to generate the documentation and being able
   to use it (e.g. via help/2) it is needed to add basic, archive, ssl and term
   packages.
   All X11 packages are provided by swi-prolog-packages.
 - Adjust pkgsrc Makefile-s logic to upstream CMake migration:
    o Uncoditionally disable not wanted packages in Makefile.common (to avoid
      possible PLIST mismatches; please note that this will probably disable
      tipc package on Linux).
      All other installed packages are enabled/disabled via
      swi-prolog-{lite,packages,jpl} Makefile.
    o Add libarchive, ossp-uuid and openssl build dependency to
      swi-prolog-packages.  Despite these are provided by swi-prolog-lite
      they are needed as part of the build of swi-prolog-packages too.
 - Remove an unconditional CHECK_WRKREF_SKIP, this was needed on FreeBSD
   but unfortunately it is not clear why.  If this is still needed please let
   me know in order to try to investigate and address that.
 - TODO: maybe there are other pkgsrc changes too worth to be documented!
