swi-prolog*: Update to 8.0.1

pkgsrc changes:
 - Rename swi-prolog to swipl to follow upstream nomenclature
 - Add all main packages (except X11) to swi-prolog-lite.
   After CMake migration in order to generate the documentation and being able
   to use it (e.g. via help/2) it is needed to add basic, archive, ssl and term
   packages.
   All X11 packages are provided by swi-prolog-packages.
 - Adjust pkgsrc Makefile-s logic to upstream CMake migration:
    o Uncoditionally disable not wanted packages in Makefile.common (to avoid
      possible PLIST mismatches; please note that this will probably disable
      tipc package on Linux!).
      All other installed packages are enabled/disabled via
      swi-prolog-{lite,packages,jpl} Makefile.
    o Add libarchive, ossp-uuid and openssl build dependency to
      swi-prolog-packages.  Despite these are provided by swi-prolog-lite
      they are needed as part of the build of swi-prolog-packages too.
 - Remove an unconditional CHECK_WRKREF_SKIP, this was needed on FreeBSD
   but unfortunately it is not clear why.  If this is still needed please let
   me know in order to try to investigate further and address that.
 - Bump API requirements to 8.0.1 in buildlink3.mk to be on the safe side
   now that shared libraries are provided on all platforms.

Changes:
8.0.1
-----
Indexing on multiple arguments together, indexing inside compounds,
Mode-directed tabling, saved states using ZIP files, many deployment
enhancements. Moved build environment to CMake and removed most of
the build tool dependencies. Builds documentation along with the
binary.

Please note that this is just a short summary. Unfortunately the
complete changelog is very long, full changelog can be found at:
