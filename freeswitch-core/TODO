* There are some bundled libs that are currently imported to pkgsrc & pkgsrc-wip.
  Nevertheless, these bundled libs, from what I could see, are modified by upstream.
  I ran into many errors while integrating pkgsrc libs instead of the bundled ones.
  Thus, further work needs to be done to make them work. 

* There are many modules that are not enabled by default. If an user requires them,
  they have to be manually enabled in ${WRKSRC}/modules.conf file. As for now, 
  defaults are enabled + some required by wip/fusionpbx (GUI interface).

* Once installed, FS is unable to identify the local_ip_v4 value.
  Meaning sofia-sip moduel cannot bind to an interface. The temporary workaround is,
  to manually set the local_ip_v4 value in conf_dir/vars.xml.
  Example:  <X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" date="local_ip_v4=[yo.ur.i.p]"/>

* The event_socket_module, which is the one fs_cli connects to,
  by default has an IPv6 configuration, therefore it is unable to load
  properly. You'll need to set to your local IP or 0.0.0.0 un the
  event_socket.conf.xml file inside autoloads/configs directory.

* If you are willing to use FusionPBX as GUI, you'll need to copy
  the scripts from FusionPBX to FS. Also, you may need to copy
  FusionPBX templates, depending on your configuration scheme.

* Use of CONF_FILES framework to avoid pkglint errors. 

* This package has only been tested on FreeBSD 11.
