* There are some bundled libs that are currently imported to pkgsrc & pkgsrc-wip.
  Nevertheless, these bundled libs are patched by upstream developers.
  I ran into many errors while integrating pkgsrc libs instead of the bundled ones.
  Thus, further work needs to be done to make them work or bundled libs are
  unavoidable.  

* Use of CONF_FILES framework to avoid pkglint errors. 

* This package has only been tested on FreeBSD 11.
