[X] Patch to support NetBSD
    FreeBSD codepath does not work for NetBSD
    => Use statvfs()
[X] Build system seems to not support that
    => Disable parallel make jobs
[X] Test on GNU/Linux
[X] Check that Big Endian platforms work too
    Seems to work out-of-the-box with GCC
    => Nevertheless ensure that __BIG_ENDIAN__ is always defined if required
[X] Configure for pkgsrc DOOMWADDIR: ${PREFIX}/share/doom
    Add Message for DOOMWADDIR location
    => Set LEGACYWADDIR to DOOMWADDIR and install legacy.wad there
[X] Add dependency for games/doom1
    This provides DOOMWADDIR/doom1.wad
    This allows to directly play Doom Episode 1 (Knee-Deep in the Dead)
[X] Honor CFLAGS/LDFLAGS/LIBS
[X] Check MKPIE/RELRO/USE_STACK_CHECK hardening flags on NetBSD/amd64
[X] Check for reproducible build (PKGSRC_MKREPRO)
[X] Check build with clang
    (Dependency generation fails)
    Problem was with clang installation, not related to package
    (DEBUG creates GCC specific options)
    Undefine DEBUG
    => Works now
[ ] Analyze why MIDI music doesn't work
[X] Check OpenGL renderer
    GNU/Linux: Looks nice
    NetBSD: Fails with:
    LLVM ERROR: Program used external function 'llvm.x86.sse41.pmaxsd' which could not be resolved!
[ ] Send NetBSD patches to upstream
[X] Check Doom Episode 2 (The Shores of Hell)
[X] Check Doom Episode 3 (Inferno)
[X] Check Ultimate Doom Episode 4 (Thy Flesh Consumed)
[X] Check Romero's 25th anniversary Episode 5 (Sigil)
    SIGIL_COMPAT.wad works with doom.wad as IWAD
    SIGIL.wad works with doomu.wad as IWAD (menu entry for Episode 5 is missing)
[X] Check Doom II (Hell on Earth)
[X] Check Final Doom Part 1 (TNT: Evilution)
[X] Check Final Doom Part 2 (The Plutonia Experiment)
[X] Check Heretic
[ ] man page with examples how to specify WADs and game type on commandline
