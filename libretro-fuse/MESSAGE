$NetBSD$

By default, FUSE emulates a 48K Spectrum, which doesn't have enough memory
or adequate sound hardware to run some newer software released after 1986.

It can be configured to emulate a more powerful 128K Spectrum by adding a
line to the RetroArch core options file:

printf 'fuse_machine = "Spectrum 128K"\n' >>\
	$HOME/.config/retroarch/retroarch-core-options.cfg

FUSE supports various joystick interfaces. Cursor is the default type.

To emulate a Kempston joystick (generally the type most commonly supported
type in games), change input_libretro_device_p1 in retroarch.cfg to "513".
