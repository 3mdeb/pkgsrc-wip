Checkov is a static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code.
It scans cloud infrastructure provisioned using Terraform,
Cloudformation, Kubernetes, Serverless or ARM Templates and
detects security and compliance misconfigurations.
Checkov also powers Bridgecrew, the developer-first platform that
codifies and streamlines cloud security throughout the development
lifecycle. Bridgecrew identifies, fixes, and prevents misconfigurations
in cloud resources and infrastructure-as-code files
