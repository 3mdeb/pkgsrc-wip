I'm working on a ACID pkg at the moment and it will need this pkg as
a dependency.

Hold off until I finish the ACID pkg then test and let me know if there
are any issues.

XXX This is a php-lib file (no php binary module). Should it still be
        renamed to php-adodb? - hubertf

Tested on NetBSD 1.6 i386.

Ta,

Adrian.
