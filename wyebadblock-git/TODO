At least with wip/surf-git it crashes with:

 GLib (gthread-posix.c): Unexpected error from C library during 'pthread_mutex_unlock': Operation not permitted.  Aborting.

To reproduce it, after installing wip/surf-git and wip/wyebadblock-git,
preparing wyebadblock:

 % mkdir -p ~/.config/wyebadblock/
 % cd ~/.config/wyebadblock/
 % ftp https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt

...and then creating a symlink so surf will load wyebadblock:

 # ln -s /usr/pkg/lib/wyebrowser/adblock.so adblock.so

Investigate further.
