converters/utf8proc: Update to 2.5.0

pkgsrc changes:
- Drop cmake
  Drive libtool directly (utf8proc can be build with a single compiler call).
  This removes the C++11 build dependency for cmake (C99 is now sufficient)
  and more build dependencies that are at least an order of magnitude larger
  than utf8proc itself.
- Add support for pkgconfig
  Install "libutf8proc.pc"

Upstream changelog for utf8proc 2.5.0 (2020-03-27):
- Unicode 13 support (#179).
- No longer report zero width for category Sk (#167).
- cmake support improvements (#173).
