converters/utf8proc: Update to 2.5.0nb1

- Drop cmake
  Drive libtool directly (utf8proc can be build with a single compiler call).
  This removes the C++11 build dependency for cmake (C99 is now sufficient)
  and more build dependencies that are at least an order of magnitude larger
  than utf8proc itself.
- Drop patch for cmake
- Add support for pkgconfig
  Install "libutf8proc.pc".
- Bump PKGREVISION for additional installed files.
- Take maintainership
