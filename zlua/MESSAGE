To begin using z.lua, put something like the following in
either ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc:

if [ -e /usr/pkg/bin/z.lua ]; then
	eval "$(lua /usr/pkg/bin/z.lua --eval posix)"
fi

Then, as z.lua learns your habits, you may use the following
command to quickly jump around your filesystem:
    $ z SOME_DIRECTORY

z.lua also has explicit support for other shells, so
you may want to consider replacing the `--eval posix'
above with:

    z.lua --eval bash
	    -or-
    z.lua --eval fish
	    -or-
    z.lua --eval zsh

See /usr/pkg/share/doc/zlua/README.md for more details.
