debootstrap (1.0.86) unstable; urgency=high

  * Rework split_inline_sig by using shell built-ins instead of trying to
    mix sed and tr together, which might work on regular systems but not
    from inside the Debian Installer (Closes: #842591). Thanks to Ansgar
    Burchardt for the proof of concept!

debootstrap (1.0.85) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * Add support for downloading and validating InRelease files, by splitting
    up detached signature from signed data.
  * Switch default mirror to deb.debian.org.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add (Ubuntu) zesty as a symlink to gutsy.

  [ Ansgar Burchardt ]
  * Add jessie-kfreebsd to merged-/usr blacklist.
  * No longer Build-Depend on makedev. The code using it was already
    removed in debootstrap 1.0.82.
  * Do not use `tar -k` for older releases which might have file
    conflicts between the packages to be installed. (Closes: #838388)
  * Error out when seeing short options. (Closes: #548880)
  * Add oldoldstable -> sid script symlink. (Closes: #792734)
  * Add buster -> sid and bullseye -> sid script symlinks.
  * Only unpack and configure the base system when there are actually
    packages to install. (Closes: #825034)
  * debootstrap.8: Use stretch instead of wheezy in examples.

  [ Marco d'Itri ]
  * Enable merged-/usr by default. (Closes: #839046)
