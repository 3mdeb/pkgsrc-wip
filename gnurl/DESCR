libgnurl is a fork of libcurl. The goal for libgnurl is to support
only HTTP and HTTPS (and only HTTP 1.x) with a single crypto backend
(GnuTLS) to ensure a small footprint and uniform experience for
developers regardless of how libcurl was compiled.

The reasons for gnurl can be read at https://gnunet.org/gnurl.

Major changes from libcurl:
* renamed the library binary from 'libcurl' to 'libgnurl'
* renamed files to ensure a system-wide installation of
  libgnurl does not result in namespace collisions with libcurl
* adjustments to the testsuite to address the gnurl specific build
