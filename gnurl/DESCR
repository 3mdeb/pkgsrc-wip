libgnurl is a fork of libcurl with the following major changes:

Compilation requirements:
* libgnurl must be compiled so that it supports only HTTP and HTTPS
  (remove Gopher, SSH, IMAP, etc.)
* libgnurl must be compiled so that it supports only GnuTLS
  (remove CaySSL, QsoSSL, GSKit, etc.)
* removed support for NTLM, GSSAPI, SPNEGO, LDAP, metalink, HTTP2
* We recommend to build GnuTLS with DANE support, provided by 'unbound'.
  This is optional.

Changes to the code:
* renamed the library binary from 'libcurl' to 'lignurl'
* renamed files to ensure a system-wide installation of
  libgnurl does not result in namespace collisions with libcurl
* adjustments to the testsuite to address the gnurl specific build

The reasons for gnurl can be read at https://gnunet.org/gnurl. The
main motivations are technical ones:
The goal of the cURL project is clearly to support many crypto
backends and many protocols..
The goal for libgnurl is to support only HTTP and HTTPS
(and only HTTP 1.x) with a single crypto backend (GnuTLS) to ensure a
small footprint and uniform experience for developers regardless of
how libcurl was compiled.
