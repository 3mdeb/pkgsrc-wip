mupdf: Update print/mupdf to 1.13.0

pkgsrc changes:
 - Directly override VERSION in files/mupdf.pc in the post-build phase
   (to avoid an extra manual step for every mupdf update)
 - Get rid of OPJ_STATIC patch hunk in patches/patch-source_fitz_load-jpx.c (it
   is no more needed, because the `-DOPJ_STATIC' is now passed in Makefile-s
   when the bundled openjpeg is used).
 - Pass HAVE_LIBCRYPTO=no to avoid requiring openssl>=1.1.0.

Changes:
1.13.0
------
* This is primarily a bugfix release.
* New "mutool sign" tool for showing and verifying digital signatures.
* Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Cyrillic, and Greek font support in mutool create.
* Improvements to annotation editing API.
