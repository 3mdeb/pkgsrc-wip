Little, just cosmetic possible changes:

 - Should we change the CATEGORIES to misc? Possible similar packages
   AFAIK are: misc/fzy, sysutils/fzf so it is a bit difficult to decide
   that! :)
 - `pkglint -Wall' warns about the COMMENT beginning with `A ', we
   can probably delete it as suggested.

Package ready for review/import.
