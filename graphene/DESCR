Graphene - a thin layer of types for graphic libraries

When creating graphic libraries you most likely end up dealing with points
and rectangles. If you're particularly unlucky, you may end up dealing
with affine matrices and 2D transformations. If you're writing a graphic
library with 3D transformations, though, you are going to hit the jackpot:
4x4 matrices, projections, transformations, vectors, and quaternions.

Most of this stuff exists, in various forms, in other libraries, but it
has the major drawback of coming along with the rest of those libraries,
which may or may not be what you want. Those libraries are also available
in various languages, as long as those languages are C++; again, it may or
may not be something you want.
