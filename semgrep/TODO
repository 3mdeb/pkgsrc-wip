- This package in order to works needs `semgrep-core' and `spacecat' binaries
  already installed.

  If possible package semgrep-core and add it as a DEPENDS (probably
  pretty tricky to build in pkgsrc due heavy git submodules use, opam
  and dune usage at build time that access external resources).
