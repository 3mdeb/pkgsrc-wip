- Some files seems to not be compiled (only the `.py' are installed).
  These are:

   % awk '/.py[co]?$/ { sub(/.py[co]?$/, "", $0); f[$0]++ }  END { for (v in f) { if (f[v] != 3) { print v } } }' < PLIST
   ${PYSITELIB}/diffoscope/comparators/ffprobe
   ${PYSITELIB}/diffoscope/comparators/zst
   ${PYSITELIB}/diffoscope/comparators/kbx
   ${PYSITELIB}/diffoscope/utils

  Investigate further!
