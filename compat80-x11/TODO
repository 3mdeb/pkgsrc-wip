- The checksum in distinfo seems incorrect (e.g. running `make checksum' fails
  due different size).
- The distfiles do not contain any version, to avoid any possible conflicts
  DIST_SUBDIR should be defined.
- The package is called `compat80-x11' but it try to fetch 8.1_RC1 installation
  sets.  Why?  Is 8.1_RC1 really needed or could 8.1 or 8.0 be fetched instead?
