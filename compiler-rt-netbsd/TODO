- Add alert (Printf() & Die()) that if ASLR/NetBSD is detected, tsan isn't possible.
  Technically we can workaround it with ReExec() and similar tricks
  but since it can be disabled on per-application basis - require it on NetBSD for
  tsan aware applications.
  This might be comparable in future for msan/NetBSD.
