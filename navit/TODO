1. Fix glib.h include problem. Remove the corresponding patch.
2. Solve NetBSD porting problem (runtime issues).
3. Find and set default options for the package.
4. Create additional package options.

On NetBSD-current the build fails due undefined __BYTE_ORDER and
__*_ENDIAN, e.g.:

> .../navit-0.5.1/navit/map/binfile/binfile.c:1737:5: warning: "__BYTE_ORDER" is not defined [-Wundef]
>  #if __BYTE_ORDER == __BIG_ENDIAN
>      ^~~~~~~~~~~~
> .../navit-0.5.1/navit/map/binfile/binfile.c:1737:21: warning: "__BIG_ENDIAN" is not defined [-Wundef]
>  #if __BYTE_ORDER == __BIG_ENDIAN
>                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding `CFLAGS.NetBSD+= -DUSE_SYS_ENDIAN_H' seems to workaround
that but it also sounds pretty kludgy!
