Still not ready for using it to update devel/coccinelle. The following issues
should be investigated further and if possible fixed:

 - pkgsrc `test' target no longer works (manually invoking that on ${WRKSRC}
   does the trick, I guess that some naughty things happen when
   compiling/linking test programs)
 - Update to coccinelle-1.0.6 breaks textproc/coccigrep
