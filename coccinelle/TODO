Still not ready for using it to update devel/coccinelle. The following issues
should be investigated further and if possible fixed:

 - Update to coccinelle-1.0.6 breaks textproc/coccigrep

   XXXleot: provide a simple command to test that.
    
    -- leot (2017/10/10)

 - When built with PYTHON_VERSION_DEFAULT=38, test fails with:

    bc_1.res
    Traceback (most recent call last):

   When built with PYTHON_VERSION_DEFAULT=27, the test score on NetBSD/amd64
   -current are:

    total score
    --------------------------------
    good = 241/554
    Current score is greater than expected :)
    (was expecting 0 but got 241)
