Distfile verification:

  * I've verified that the md5 hash and size of the distfile downloaded
    from ctan, blindtext.tar.xz, match the values given in the current
    version of the texlive database entry for blindtext in
      http://mirrors.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.xz
    and the hashes in distinfo were calculated using that file.

Category choice: see ../tex-blindtext/TODO

License choice: see ../tex-blindtext/TODO

Checklist for import to pkgsrc:

  * Reevaluate my choice of parent directory.  If changed from devel to
    print, reverse the order of the items in CATEGORIES in Makefile.

  * Reevaluate my choice of license.

  * Mirror the distfile: once the distfile has been copied to pkgsrc
    mirrors, the line
      TEXLIVE_USE_CTAN=	yes
    should be removed from the Makefile.

  * Import.

  * Activate: in devel/Makefile, add
      SUBDIR+=	tex-blindtext
