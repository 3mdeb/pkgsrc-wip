There is currently no game engine in pkgsrc that really can handle this PWAD.

General Boom compatibility is not sufficient because the levels are huge and
create blockmap and other problems. Some levels are playable with more or less
clipping problems on Doom Legacy and PrBoom+, but others don't even load or
crash the engine.

Update:
games/doomlegacy and wip/prboom-plus should now be good enough to play it.
