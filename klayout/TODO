- Tested only on NetBSD/amd64 7.0 and 7.99.25
- Currently rpath or LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not properly set
- make install is not implemented yet.
  (thus PLIST is not ready)
- (Test is done before make package, by:
   env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/pkg/lib:/usr/pkg/qt4/lib   \
   /export/WRKOBJDIR/wip/klayout/work/klayout-0.24.5/bin.netbsd-32-gcc-release/klayout
  )
- Several hard coding for string gcc ar etc
- ruby version handling is not properly setup
- MAKE_JOBS= may not be in effect ?
