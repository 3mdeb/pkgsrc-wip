To revive Zabbix packages, following process is proposed:

- Packages sysutils/zabbix and sysutils/zabbix-frontend
  will be kept on version 4.0 (LTS supported until october 2021)

- Packages zabbix50-server et al., will contain 5.0 LTS release
  and its updates.

- In the future, zabbix52-server et al., will contain 5.2 standard
  release and its updates. The same will apply for 5.4.

- Once 6.0 LTS is out, zabbix60- packages will be created, obeying the
  above mentioned schema.
