Tests fail because a invalid variable identifier is tried to be exported:

 | ===> Testing for chicken-5.0.0rc3
 | cd tests; sh runtests.sh
 | ======================================== repository search path ...
 | (/usr/pkg/lib/chicken/9)
 | (PASS) (repository-path) contains something by default
 |  TOTALS:
 |   1 tests completed in 0.272 seconds
 |   1 (100.00%) tests passed
 |   0 (0.00%) tests failed
 | export: .MAKE.LEVEL.ENV: bad variable name

.MAKE.LEVEL.ENV is used internally by make(1) (not gmake!) and due the `.'
it is not a valid identifier for shell variable, hence the corresponding
export fails.
