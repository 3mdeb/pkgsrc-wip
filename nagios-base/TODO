TODO list for nagios-base
	- Create a rc.d script. I have one already but I don't like it.
	- A little more testing.
	- Add apache installation instructions to some post install
message, instead of always looking at doco.
	- Add optional support for MySQL (WITH_MYSQL=1) or PgSQL (WITH_POSTGRES=1)
Done

Update to 1.1.
