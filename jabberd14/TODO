# \todo This is jabberd14, which makes sense given jabberd2 in pkgsrc
# proper, and longstanding confusion where people who intend to use
# jabberd2 end up with 14.   If so, 

# \todo Explain why, if the version is 1.6.1.1 this doesn't use the
# 1.6.1.1 github release tag.  In particular, it looks like the tag is
# on master, isn't actually the release, and has structural changes
# relative to the release.  (Perhaps this is a clue that upstream is
# overdue for a release :-).
