Definitions of the meaning of Unicode characters

   The newunicodechar lets you define more friendly the meaning of Unicode
characters; it requires that the document is processed by (pdf)LaTeX with
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} or by XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX: it provides the syntax

   \newunicodechar{<char>}{<code>}

where <char> is some (directly typed in) Unicode character and <code> is
what we need to be substituted to <char>.
