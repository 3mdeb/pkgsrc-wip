tex-newunicodechar: Imported 1.2

newunicodechar - Definitions of the meaning of Unicode characters

   The newunicodechar lets you define more friendly the meaning of Unicode
characters; it requires that the document is processed by (pdf)LaTeX with
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} or by XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX: it provides the syntax

   \newunicodechar{<char>}{<code>}

where <char> is some (directly typed in) Unicode character and <code> is
what we need to be substituted to <char>.

Changelog for 1.2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release was necessary because now (April 2018) LaTeX assumes
UTF-8 encoding unless countermanded by explicitly loading a different
encoding with inputenc (or inputenx).
