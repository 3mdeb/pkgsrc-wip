Update 2.5.5 to 2.6  
----------------------
(from http://www.freetype.org/)
2015-06-08 FreeType 2.6
  FreeType 2.6 has been released. This is a new major release that
  provides a better (and simpler) thread-safety model. Among other new
  features we now have auto-hinting support for Arabic and Thai,
  together with much improved handling of Apple's GX TrueType variation
  font format.
  (ChangeLog from 2.5.5 to 2.6 extends some 1600 lines, consult with it
  if necessary, thanks)
