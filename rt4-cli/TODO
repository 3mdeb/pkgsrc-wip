- Term::ReadLine is provided by lang/perl5 too.
  However, with it no readline(3) (or editline(3)) functionality
  is available on at least NetBSD -current.  Investigate further
  (probably not an rt4-cli problem but a more general
  Term::ReadLine one, if that's addressed the dependency to
  p5-Term-ReadLine package can be removed).
