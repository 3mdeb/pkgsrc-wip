- Add a comment about patches/patch-include_tig_tig.h
- Some graphical artifacts (e.g. where `main' and `diff' views are present)
  should be investigated and fixed, to reproduce them:
   + press enter 
   + press down arrow
  After that the `main' view is mostly completely blank except for the current
  two entries.
  patch-src_view.c workarounds that.
- Add support for test by adding `TEST_TARGET= test' and investigate with curses
  could not be initialized when `TERM= dumb' (and maybe other possible problems
  too!)
