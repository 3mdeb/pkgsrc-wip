- Some part needs bmake and the other part needs gmake
- ./bin/rstar only accepts install as an argument for 
  our purpose, and 'install' seems to do
   configure
   build
   install

  (and install part needs gmake)


current error messages are:

Found /tmp/wip/rakudo-star/work/rakudo-star-2020.10/bin/moar version 2020.10, which is new enough.
Cleaning up ...
You can now use '/usr/pkg/bin/gmake' to build NQP.
After that, '/usr/pkg/bin/gmake test' will run some tests and
'/usr/pkg/bin/gmake install' will install NQP.
