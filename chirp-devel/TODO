* VERSION

Figure out the version problem.   Ticket filed upstream asking for clarification:
  https://chirp.danplanet.com/issues/8067

It seems that version according to chirp is "daily-YYYYMMNDD".  This
has multiple issues for pkgsrc:
  * "-" is not allowed
  * "daily" is not a version number
  * "daily" does not clearly sort after 0.4.1
  * (plus as described in the ticket, the future is unclear

Options seem to be:
  * Use YYYYMMDD as the version, and expect users to perform manual
    intervention if there are ever releases.
  * Use 0.5.YYYYMMDD using "0.5" to represent "daily".
