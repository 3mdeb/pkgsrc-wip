2.1.30 (13-Apr-2020)

  New Features

    - Thanks to Jim Popovitch, there is now a dmarc_moderation_addresses
      list setting that can be used to apply dmarc_moderation_action to mail
      From: addresses listed or matching listed regexps.  This can be used
      to modify mail to addresses that don't accept external mail From:
      themselves.

    - There is a new MAX_LISTNAME_LENGTH setting.  The fix for LP: #1780874
      obtains a list of the names of all the all the lists in the installation
      in order to determine the maximum length of a legitimate list name.  It
      does this on every web access and on sites with a very large number of
      lists, this can have performance implications.  See the description in
      Defaults.py for more information.

    - Thanks to Ralf Jung there is now the ability to add text based captchas
      (aka textchas) to the listinfo subscribe form.  See the documentation
      for the new CAPTCHA setting in Defaults.py for how to enable this.  Also
      note that if you have custom listinfo.html templates, you will have to
      add a <mm-captcha-ui> tag to those templates to make this work.  This
      feature can be used in combination with or instead of the Google
      reCAPTCHA feature added in 2.1.26.

    - Thanks to Ralf Hildebrandt the web admin Membership Management section
      now has a feature to sync the list's membership with a list of email
      addresses as with the bin/sync_members command.

    - There is a new drop_cc list attribute set from DEFAULT_DROP_CC.  This
      controls the dropping of addresses from the Cc: header in delivered
      messages by the duplicate avoidance process.  (LP: #1845751)

    - There is a new REFUSE_SECOND_PENDING mm_cfg.py setting that will cause
      a second request to subscribe to a list when there is already a pending
      confirmation for that user.  This can be set to Yes to prevent
      mailbombing of a third party by repeatedly posting the subscribe form.
