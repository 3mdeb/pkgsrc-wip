IMPORTANT:
Currently lacking an install / PLIST!
Need bootstrap for platforms for which upstream doesn't release binaries

Secondary:
Test target doesn't work

Maybe not worth caring about:
LLVM is builtin, not a dependency (jakllsch mentions it might be hard to tear out)
make distinfo is currently a lot more of a pain
