- obnc-libstd is licensed under Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, but that
  license doesn't seem to be in $PKGSRC/licenses. For now it's left as GPL v3
  (same license as obnc) until we can figure out what to do about this.

- obnc-libstd fails to build, likely because of the soft build failures
  noted in obnc/TODO.

- obnc and obnc-libstd both apparently have ${PREFIX}/doc/obnc/obncdoc/index.html
  files. So be prepared for PLIST conflicts once this package builds successfully.

- Make sure ${PREFIX}/share/doc/obnc/obncdoc/std gets installed.

- Improve the DESCR.
