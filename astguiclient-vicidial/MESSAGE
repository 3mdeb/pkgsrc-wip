There are some perl scripts you might want to run to populate the MySQL
database, which is neccesary to use this GUI client for asterisk.

Please check the steps needed to properly configure astGUIclient in:
${WRKSRC}/docs/SCRATCH_INSTALL.txt or
${WRKSRC}/docs/BASE_INSTALL.txt (summarized).

It also contains optional dependencies you might want to check.

Also, you should install the asterisk and asterisk-perl versions supported 
by this package, imported as: 

* wip/asterisk11-vicidial

This was tested using Apache v2.4 using www/ap-php.
