* This software is installed by the PERL script provided by upstream.
  Meaning, after running this script, ${MAKE} deinstall will not work
  if you have the need to deinstall the files. Thus, you'll have to
  manually delete the files.
* Only tested on FreeBSD 11 x86_64.
* Document options in mk/defaults/options.description.
