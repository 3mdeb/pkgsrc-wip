* The install script is better used in interactive mode. If you want
  to avoid this, please review the install script help by executing:
   << perl install.pl --help  >>
* This software is installed by the PERL script provided by upstream.
  Meaning, after running this script, ${MAKE} deinstall will not work
  if you have the need to deinstall the files. Thus, you'll have to
  manually delete the files.
* The PLIST is empty for the same reason previously stated.
