The current milestone is to detect in Monitor Callback the following events:
 - process termination - works, appropriate return status passed to LLDB
 - execve(2) - detected but process hangs
 - software breakpoint (TRAP_BRKPT) - ?
 - single step - ?
 - fork/vfork-done - ?
 - lwp creation/termination - ?
 - hardware breakpoint - ?
 - other signal passed to tracee - hangs

Short-term goals in next milestone:
 - fix conflict with system-wide py-six
 - add support for auxv read operation
 - switch resolution of pid -> path to executable from /proc to sysctl(7)
 - recognize Real-Time Signals (SIGRTMIN-SIGRTMAX)
 - upstream !NetBSDProcessPlugin code
 - switch std::call_once to llvm::call_once

To be done later:
 - registers' accessors
 - single step support
 - thread resume/suspend operation
 - i386 support
 - upstream NetBSD support
 - adapt upstream Python tests to run on NetBSD and pass as many of them as
   possible
 - import LLDB into base
 - add NetBSD specific ATF tests verifying fundamental functionality of LLDB

and of course fix as many bugs as possible
