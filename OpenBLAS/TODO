The aim of this package is to build a blas library for pkgsrc with optimized
kernels for all processors, dynamically chosen at runtime, to allow distribution
as a binary package. This gets quite large (~ 100 MB) and pkgsrc has to deal with
different types of processor architectures, operating systems and compilers. In my
opinion the only way to deal with this is to build all of pkgsrc with the most recent
GCC in lang/gcc.

OpenBLAS has support for the processors listed in '* Supported List'
at the end of this TODO. There should be an option to choose 64 or 32
bit depending on build system. Right now only 64 bit kernels are built. 
ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM should be adjusted for all possible platforms. 

If you ask three people involved in Numerics, they want over a dozen ways to build
OpenBLAS for the special purposes of different simulation codes. In fact I use
four different ways at work, but this package should only have a small number of
options to keep it managable. 

If you want to use other C and Fortran compilers besides gcc 6.2, then change
GCC_REQD or fiddle with PKGSRC variables. Good luck and may the force be with you.
