For pkgsrc installations the shaarli package is installed in non-default
locations:

  Data files:       ${VARBASE}/shaarli/data/
  Cache directory:  ${VARBASE}/shaarli/tmp/
  Document root:    ${PREFIX}/share/shaarli/

You will also need to make shaarli accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following lines
to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/roundcube.conf
