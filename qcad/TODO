The application starts and seems to find the libraries/plugins ok now

  -- some button images are missing, eg the back button (press the Line tool, the top button should be a < arrow)

     the back button should be loaded by CadToolBarPanel.js using
	 autoPath("scripts/Widgets/CadToolBar/Back.svg")

     ktrace seems to show that the image is being loaded, its just not being used..

  -- themes -> yes
  -- languages -> yes
  -- linetypes -> yes
  -- patterns -> yes
  -- fonts -> ?
  -- library -> no
     complains that database not loading
     should library be in /usr/pkg/share/qcad/library?


I think that icon images not loading and database not loading are the same issue -- that QCad is not loading the Qt4 plugins
the ktrace shows that it looks for /usr/pkg/lib/qcad/plugins/sqldrivers (which was not found) at least.. and Qt has plugins
to handle icons and suchlike.

Need to look into that -- the make system does say to copy plugins over from qt4/plugins but I don't think that should be necessary



NB when changing preferences I get a warning
  Warning:  AppPreferences.js: Exception:  Error: include: cannot read file 'scripts/Pro/Layer/AddLayerPro/AddLayerPro.js'

I guess this is because we are not Pro version and do not have these scripts -- quit and restart to change language etc
