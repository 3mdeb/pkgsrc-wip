The application starts and seems to be fully working, except that because it
expects to be in an application bundle, it expects to find the Qt plugins in
its own plugins folder which the build system would copy there.

The symptom of that is that library doesn't work as the Qt SQL plugin is not
there, and some button images are missing because the Qt imageformat plugins
are not loaded.  Perhaps other issues too, I don't know.

A short term solution would be to copy the files from /usr/pkg/qt4/plugins/*
to /usr/pkg/lib/qcad/plugins/*. The files needed (as of Qt 4.8.7) are

	imageformats/libqgif.so
	imageformats/libqico.so
	imageformats/libqjpeg.so
	imageformats/libqsvg.so
	imageformats/libqtiff.so
	imageformats/libqtga.so
	sqldrivers/libqsqlite.so
	codecs/libqcncodecs.so
	codecs/libqjpcodecs.so
	codecs/libqkrcodecs.so
	codecs/libqtwcodecs.so

The proper fix would to make QCad load the plugins from the Qt directory but
I'm not sure how to go about that and have no time at present.
