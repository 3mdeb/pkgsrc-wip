The application starts ok and asks for initial setup (language, page size, units etc)
but then at 70% initializing add-ons, showing AutoZoomView it fails:

I started it with the qcad -enable-script-debugger and it shows the same. It seems that
leCommand is a QLineEdit object (should have been RCommandLine), and commandConfirmed is
a signal provided by the RCommandLine class.

I think this means that the library/plugins just haven't been libtooled and/or loaded correctly

for some reason they are all .a files except for some of the plugins. I think they should be .so
