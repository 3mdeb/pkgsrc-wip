The application starts and seems to find the libraries/plugins ok now


  -- some button images are missing, eg the back button (press the Line tool, the top button should be a < arrow)

     the back button is scripts/Widgets/CadToolBar/Back.svg and it should be loaded by CadToolBarPanel.js

  -- themes -> yes
  -- languages -> yes
  -- linetypes -> yes
  -- patterns -> yes
  -- fonts -> no?
  -- library -> no
     complains that database not loading
     should library be in /usr/pkg/share/qcad/library?


NB when changing preferences I get a warning
  Warning:  AppPreferences.js: Exception:  Error: include: cannot read file 'scripts/Pro/Layer/AddLayerPro/AddLayerPro.js'

I guess this is because we are not Pro version and do not have these scripts -- quit and restart to change language etc



loading a .dxf file crashes with an error

/usr/pkg/lib/qcad/plugins/libqcaddxf.so: Undefined PLT symbol "_ZN6DL_DxfC1Ev" (symnum = 1293)
