* ImageMagick is not properly detected as version 7, as the guard for
  it doesn't pick up version 7 include.
* python3 support must be tested (new in this release)
* `make test' no longer works, build of tests fail with:

 | test/test_decode.c:24:10: fatal error: argp.h: No such file or directory
 | #include <argp.h>

   investigate further!
* python2 is (probably) accidentally picked up
