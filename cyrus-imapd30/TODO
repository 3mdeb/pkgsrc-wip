Warning: this pkg is currently under construction. It was created as a
copy of mail/cyrus-imap24. It cannot currently be expected that it can
be built, let alone that it will work as expected. I plan to keep the
pkg up to date here so that the progress is transparent. I am open to
suggestions or active support.

Next steps:

1) Make it build the most basic way

2) Evaluation of the patches of the existing Cyrus-imap-pkgs and
   their applicability for cyrus-imap 3

3) Possibly create further patches for cyrus-imap 3 (especially with
   regard to the newly added functions CalDAV / CardDAV), if necessary

4) Review and adjustment of scripts / provided files (configuration
   examples, man pages)

5) Fine-tuning of the build
