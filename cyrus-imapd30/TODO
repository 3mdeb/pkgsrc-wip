Warning: this pkg is currently under construction. It was created as a
copy of mail/cyrus-imap24. It cannot currently be expected that it can
be built, let alone that it will work as expected. I plan to keep the
pkg up to date here so that the progress is transparent. I am open to
suggestions or active support.

Done:

- Make it build the most basic way [DONE]

Next steps:

- Make it install

- Update PLIST (take care of ldap / http options)

- Integrate / regenerate documentation at build time

- Evaluation of the patches of the existing Cyrus-imap-pkgs and
  their applicability for cyrus-imap 3

- Possibly create further patches for cyrus-imap 3 (especially with
  regard to the newly added functions CalDAV / CardDAV), if necessary

- Review and adjustment of scripts / provided files (configuration
  examples, man pages)

- Fine-tuning of the build

Bugs:

- Kerberos support, PostgreSQL and MySQL are currently not tested
