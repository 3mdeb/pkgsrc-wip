- ./install tries to build extra stuff, and is rigged to ignore those
  errors and keep going, as those components are considered optional.

  We might want to consider patching that out and cause a hard-failure
  if errors are detected, since things randomly not getting built/installed
  might not play nice with PLIST.

- PLIST currently doesn't include everything, due to the soft build failures
  noted above. It may also be responsible for obnc-libstd failing to build too.

- Something built by ./install wants libSDL, so we'll want to use the Options
  framework to selectively-enable using it (which'll probably require patching
  the ./install script).

- Verify if we should use ``BUILDLINK_DEPMETHOD.obnc?= build`` and/or
  ``.include "../../devel/boehm-gc/buildlink3.mk"`` in buildlink3.mk.

- Update DESCR so it's not just a copy of COMMENT.
