- ./install tries to build extra stuff, and is rigged to ignore those
  errors and keep going, as those components are considered optional.

  We might want to consider patching that out and cause a hard-failure
  if errors are detected, since things randomly not getting built/installed
  might not play nice with PLIST.

- PLIST currently doesn't include everything, due to the soft build failures
  noted above.

- Something built by ./install wants libSDL, so we'll want to use the Options
  framework to selectively-enable using it (which'll probably require patching
  the ./install script).

- Update DESCR so it's not just a copy of COMMENT.

- Investigate the Standard Library tarball from <http://miasap.se/obnc/>,
  and whether it should be installed along with this pkg, or separated-out
  into its own pkg.
