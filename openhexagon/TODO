This seems to be working if slow on my computer

- depends on wip/sfml+ which has a note that joystick input
  is not available but might not be too much work and I don't
  know if relevant for this game

- this is the last tagged version of OpenHexagon and is 7
  years old but there has been some work upstream since

- the dependencies suck there are no version numbers have
  just used the tag that was used in the submodule. The
  submodules need to be built before we run cmake here so
  have packaged them separately

- there are some 'Assets' which a script can fetch using
  wget, it seems to be some music files for packs don't
  know if important or if possible to download in pkgsrc
  framework

- I have written a wrapper script which sets up a
  $HOME/.openhexagon dir with symlinks to the assets etc
  it kind of works but could be better, particularly
  need to look at what happens to config files and/or if
  it is only the Profiles/ folder which needs to be written
  in which case that could be ~/.openhexagon

- the game itself bombs out sometimes complaining that it
  is too slow. is this simply to do with lack of GL ?

- there was a complaint about network connectivity needs to
  be checked
