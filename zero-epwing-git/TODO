- Haven't tested how Linux/FreeBSD/OpenBSD will react to the
  exclusion of linking libintl via |UNIX AND NOT APPLE| in CMakeLists.txt.
  But for now, it works on both NetBSD and macOS.

- Internal (lib)eb doesn't seem to honor CFLAGS.

- On NetBSD, `-std={c99,gnu99}' is required in CFLAGS for the build to succeed.
  However, it's not required for macOS/clang, and it in fact causes the build to fail
  on that platform.

  We could either set CFLAGS depending on the platform/compiler, or patch the zero-epwing
  code, since (at least at a cursory glance) it didn't look like too much would need to
  be changed.

- The bundled libjansson shouldn't be built, since we use the pkgsrc-supplied one.
