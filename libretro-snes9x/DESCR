Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for the
easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that can plug
straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development interface is
open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator and game cores
also in their own programs or devices.

Snes9x is an emulator for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. This package
is derived from the master repository of Snes9x. It has greater accuracy and
worse performance than Snes9x 2005/2010. It has a less strict approach to
accuracy than bsnes and therefore runs fewer problematic games than bsnes, but
has much better performance. For more information, see:
