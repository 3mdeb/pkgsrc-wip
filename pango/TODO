The additional patches should not be required:
| 
| # pkg-config --cflags harfbuzz
| -I/usr/pkg/include/harfbuzz -I/usr/pkg/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/pkg/lib/glib-2.0/include -I/usr/pkg/include

Thanks wiz@ for pointing out.


But wip/fltk-devel doesn't work correctly without the patches, maybe the CFLAGS
are ignored there. This package will be removed after fltk-devel is repaired.
