Need to figure out passing LANG=en_US.UTF-8 as an environment variable as seeing these errors:

==> iex (compile)                                                                                                                                              warning: the VM is running with native name encoding of latin1 which may cause Elixir to malfunction as it expects utf8. Please ensure your locale is set to UTF-8 (which can be verified by running "locale" in your shell) 

If I do a make outside of Pkgsrc I don't see these errors as my locale is set correctly, but I don't understand Pkgsrc's build environment. I tried setting these:

MAKE_ENV += 'LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"'
MAKE_ENV += 'LC_LANG="en_US.UTF-8"'
MAKE_ENV += 'LC_ALL=""'

But no luck.
