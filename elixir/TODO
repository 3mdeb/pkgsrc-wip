Remove from WIP

This exists in Pkgsrc proper now and can be removed from here soon (once some
Makefile changes have been pulled across).

As soon as the locale stuff appears in lang/elixir we can remove this from here.

EDIT: Turns out the locale stuff is not really necessary. It purely removes the warnings during build. Will remove this from WIP
