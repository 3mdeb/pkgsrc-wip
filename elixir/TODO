We may want to pass LANG=en_US.UTF-8 as an environment variable as seeing these errors:

==> iex (compile)                                                                                                                                              warning: the VM is running with native name encoding of latin1 which may cause Elixir to malfunction as it expects utf8. Please ensure your locale is set to UTF-8 (which can be verified by running "locale" in your shell)
