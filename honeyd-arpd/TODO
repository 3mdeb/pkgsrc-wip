$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.2 2003/07/09 15:40:11 adrian_p Exp $

The name of the program needs to be resolved as there is already an
arpd package in pkgsrc,  so I've called this package honeyd-arpd.  
I've emailed the author of this software a few times now but have not 
received a definite response.  Consider this name temporary.

Please test and let me know if there are any other issues.

Tested on NetBSD 1.6 i386.

Ta,

Adrian.
